Restaurant Ordering System Web Application
Overview
This repository contains the codebase for our restaurant ordering system, a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of food ordering and management for restaurants. Our team comprises four developers, with two specializing in front-end development using Next.js and two focusing on back-end development with Java Spring Boot.

Technologies
Front-End: Next.js (React Framework)
Back-End: Java Spring Boot
Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL
Front-End Development
The front-end is built with Next.js, emphasizing responsive design, state management, and API integration.

Run Front-End:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
Key Libraries:
Tailwind CSS for styling
Context API / Redux for state management
Axios for API requests
Back-End Development
The back-end is developed using Java Spring Boot, focusing on RESTful API design, security, and database integration.

Run Back-End:
bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Key Features:
RESTful API endpoints
OAuth 2.0/JWT for authentication
Hibernate ORM for database interactions
